## Describing the Dataset and What it Contains:
The dataset that we selected contains the average price of electricity from the years 1993-2019. It is organized by the type of customer being serviced (Commercial, Industrial, Residential, Transportation, Other), the Industry Sector (Total Electric Industry) and this data is included for each US state for each of the years present. This data set can be useful in a variety of ways. For consumers, the data can be used to understand how electricity prices have fluctuated over time and how these changes have affected households and businesses. This information can be valuable for advocating for consumer rights, promoting affordability initiatives, and fostering energy conservation efforts. In addition, it can be useful to researchers and policy makers in the sense that industry analysts can use the data to identify long-term trends in electricity prices across states. Understanding how prices have evolved over time can provide insights into factors such as changes in energy production, consumption patterns, regulatory policies, and economic conditions. From this, policy makers can assess the effectiveness of past energy policies by examining how electricity prices have changed over the years. This information can help policymakers make data-driven decisions when designing new policies or refining existing ones.


## Two Team Generated Questions and Why They are Interesting/ Important:
1. What is the average electricity price by state for all customers (residential, transportation, commercial, industrial)?
   
This would be interesting/important because it provides a comprehensive view of the overall cost of electricity in different regions. Analyzing this data can reveal disparities in pricing across states, which can be influenced by factors such as energy source mix, regulatory policies, infrastructure investments, and demand patterns. 

2. What does the average price of electricity look like for residential electricity users in Georgia in 2027?
   
Forecasting the prices of electricity for residential consumers in Georgia can be important for many reasons. First, Georgia's average residential electricity price compared to neighboring states or national averages can influence its competitiveness in attracting residents, businesses, and industries. Lower electricity prices may make the state more attractive for relocation or investment. Additionally, residential electricity prices directly impact households' budgets. Knowing the average price of electricity in Georgia allows residents to anticipate and plan for their energy expenses, helping them make informed financial decisions. This information is especially relevant to peers our age scouting out potential job locations/places to live post-graduation. 


## The Manipulations Applied to the Data Set as Part of the Analysis:
When downloading the data the initial thing done was the use of a Data interpreter. This helps remove a lot of the null values that the data had when coming from the Excel file. Furthermore when looking at the data in Tableau it had an excess of columns leading to the graph not producing correct results. We then decided to pivot the tables because we saw the column headers not giving useful data. Once the columns were pivoted it compressed the data into 3-4 columns of useful data allowing us to do proper predictions seen in our data in our visualizations. Without doing that the ability to forecast was not there because much of the data was confusing producing incorrect results and interpretation.


## Analysis and Results:
Visualization 1: Using Tableau, our group found the average electricity prices across all states, examining different customer segments like residential, transportation, and commercial from the years 1990 to 2020. After examining the results, we found states with larger populations generally have higher average electricity prices, such as in states like California, Texas, New York, New Jersey, and Florida. This may be due to  factors such as infrastructure costs, higher standards of living, and transmission expenses that contribute to the overall increase in prices.

However,  Hawaii and Alaska have the highest average electricity prices compared to all of the United States from 1990 to 2020. Firstly, both Alaska and Hawaii face the challenge of being geographically isolated from the contiguous United States. This isolation translates to higher costs associated with transporting fuel and essential equipment for electricity generation. Also, their climate conditions require more electricity demands than those in most states. Alaska's cold climate causes more energy to be used for heating, while Hawaii's tropical climate causes more electricity to be used for cooling systems.. 

Visualization 2: In this data set, we forecasted the average prices of electricity for residential customers in Georgia. By analyzing this data, we discovered that the average price of electricity will be decreasing in the next 8 years. This decrease might be due to a few reasons. Firstly, advancements in renewable energy technologies like solar and wind power have made electricity cheaper. There is also an increased competition among energy providers and efforts to promote energy efficiency and it has led to lower prices. Finally, shifts in consumer behavior towards energy-saving practices further contribute to the overall decrease in electricity prices for residential users. More people are adopting energy-saving practices, which reduces overall consumption and contributes to lower prices. We are also seeing the cost of natural gas being reduced which in many cases  is a major source fuel for the harnessing and production of electricity.  It tends to be a trickle down effect as we begin to see lower cost in production providers can in turn charge consumers less. Overall, these factors could be the reasons for the decrease in average prices for residential users in Georgia.
